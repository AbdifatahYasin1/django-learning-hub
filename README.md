```markdown
### Assignment: Student Record System

---

#### Part 1: Frontend Templates with Bootstrap

![Student Record System UI Example](StduentsUI.png)

*Example of a simple Student Record System interface using Bootstrap:*

- A header bar with the system name  
- A search box to filter student records  
- A table showing student ID, name, email  
- Edit and Delete action buttons  
- Add Student button for creating new entries  

**Functional Requirements:**

- Build static pages using Bootstrap that represent the student record system UI  
- Student List page displaying multiple students (use static sample data)  
- Student Detail page showing detailed info of a single student  
- Add and Edit Student forms with proper Bootstrap form controls (no backend functionality yet)  
- Navigation bar to navigate between pages  
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile  

**Requirements:**

- Design and build static HTML templates for the Student Record System using Bootstrap  
- Use Bootstrap components for navbar, forms, buttons, tables, etc.

**Submission:**

- Push your static HTML + CSS templates to your GitHub repo  
- Email the repo link to: `sendtohereyourdocuments@gmail.com`  
- Deadline: August 20, 2025, 11:59 PM  

---

#### Part 2: Full Django CRUD and Backend Integration

**Functional Requirements:**

- Create a `Student` model with fields like name, age, email, and course  
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student records  
- Use Django forms and ModelForms for add/edit student functionality with validation  
- Only authenticated users can add, edit, or delete students (login required)  
- Display student data dynamically in templates  
- Use Bootstrap to style the Django templates (reuse templates from Part 1)  
- Implement navigation and user feedback (success/error messages)  

**Requirements:**

- Implement the full backend functionality in Django  
- Integrate Bootstrap templates from Part 1 with dynamic data  
- Use user authentication to protect sensitive operations  

**Submission:**

- Push your full Django project code to your GitHub repo  
- Email the repo link to: `sendtohereyourdocuments@gmail.com`  
- Deadline: Sept 10, 2025, 11:59 PM
